# Amazon Price Tracker Project

This python project tracks the price of an item on Amazon and emails you when the item has had a reduction in price. It does this by scraping the product information from the web page for the price of the item and compares it to whatever price you choose (The price you're willing to buy the item for). If the price of the item falls below the value that you set, it sends you an email with the new price as well as the description of the item.
